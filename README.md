# DNS SOCKS Proxy

A simple dns proxy to tunnel DNS requests over a socks proxy (for example, over ssh or Tor). This can come in handy when setting up transparent proxies.

It chooses a random DNS server for each request from the file "resolv.conf" which is a newline delimited list of DNS servers.

The daemon must be run as root in order for it to bind to port 53.

Qiuyi: Can use in Linux, Unix, and OpenWRT. I have already tested in Ubuntu, RedHat, macOS 10.12, and OpenWRT 15.05 (mips)

## Usage

Usage: ./dns-proxy [options]

With no parameters, the configuration file is read from 'dns_proxy.conf'.

* -n          -- No configuration file (socks: 127.0.0.1:9050, listener: 0.0.0.0:53).
* -h          -- Print this message and exit.
* -c file     -- Read from specified configuration file.

## Configuration

The configuration file should contain any of the following options (and ignores lines that begin with '#'):

* socks_addr  -- socks listener address
* socks_port  -- socks listener port
* listen_addr -- address for the dns proxy to listen on
* listen_port -- port for the dns proxy to listen on (most cases 53)
* set_user    -- username to drop to after binding
* set_group   -- group to drop to after binding
* resolv_conf -- location of resolv.conf file to read from
* log_file    -- location to log to (should be /dev/null unless debugging).

Any non-specified options will be set to their defaults:

* socks_addr  = 127.0.0.1
* socks_port  = 9050
* listen_addr = 0.0.0.0
* listen_port = 53
* set_user    = nobody
* set_group   = nobody
* resolv_conf = resolv.conf
* log_file    = /dev/null

## Installation

On Arch linux, the dns proxy can be installed from the AUR at: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tcpdnsproxy/.

```
wget https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tc/tcpdnsproxy/PKGBUILD
makepkg
sudo pacman -U tcpdnsproxy-20130128-1-any.pkg.tar.xz

# edit /etc/dns_proxy/dns_proxy.conf as necessary
sudo systemctl start tcpdnsproxy

# to autorun on put run:
sudo systemctl enable tcpdnsproxy
```

On other distributions:

```
git clone https://github.com/jtRIPper/dns-tcp-socks-proxy.git
cd dns-tcp-socks-proxy
make

# edit dns_proxy.conf as necessary
./dns_proxy
```

After running the daemon, the system should be configured to use the proxy automatically.
